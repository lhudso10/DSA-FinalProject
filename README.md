# DSA-FinalProject

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

During this course, I implemented a program that successfully addresses the problem of maintaining and accessing a schools course catalog. This includings storing the course data in a data structure, along with printing out the courses in order, and searching for a courses full information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

When approaching the problem, I had the option of utilizing different data structures: a list, a hash table, and a binary search tree. The list did a good job of storing the data easily, but is more complicated to print out in order. The hash table makes printing in order slightly easier, but the best choice is a binary search tree, as it stores the data in "order" and can easily be accessed through recursion.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I did not encounter any major road blocks. Making sure that the data was uploaded and sliced correctly into its different attributes was a bit harder of an aspect to add, but a little research and testing allowed me to find a successful way to do so. I read the line, then split that line into different elements using a dilimeter ",", pushing them back into a vector for storing. From there, objects were easily made from the vector information.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs? 

This program allowed me to get much more comfortable with reading files and utilizing data structures. I had not used binary search trees, and can see how their application can be very beneficial in keeping data organized and easily accessed. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

The more you practice, the better you get! Therefore, I believe that this program evolved the way I write programs because of continued practice with different types of coding techniques and learning new ones to make my programming even more efficient and faster.
